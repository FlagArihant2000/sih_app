This is the implementation of the android app for Smart India Hackathon (Software Edition 2020). The [problem statement](https://sih2020.sih.gov.in/nodal-centers/prin-l-n-welingkar-institute-of-management-development-research-weschool/) demands the automation of number plate detection, identification and monitoring in different scenarios.
